Although agile processes are becoming commonplace in many organisations, 
many developers and projects are still stuck in some form of waterfall and
classical project management, especially in large organisations. (Like me.)
But within the constraints of classical project management, some agile 
practices can be applied. In the case of this post, I will look at 
iterations. 

Iterations are not something new that agile processes brought to the development
scene. But they make it a core mechanic of the process. The core idea is to
reduce the feedback loop. One thing that the water wall fails to do well.

The classic waterfall model splits the project into 5 steps. Each step feeds 
into the next and they are processes in order. The primary problem with 
waterfall is that commonly projects may take years to complete. The first feed 
back received is then the project enters testing. This is two thirds to three 
quarters into the project and is may turn out not tow work out properly.

The simplest adaptation of the waterfall process is to reduce the project 
length. Instead of implementing a new version of the software over the course of 
two years, you implement a version over the course of three months. Over the course 
of two years you will then have 8 versions, though not every version needs to go
to the customer.

The primary advantage is that existing process can be used. This is especially
useful if you need to follow a specific process for compliance with laws and
regulations. It also gives stake holders the option to change their mind about 
what requirements they want to have implemented.

A different approach is to maintain the requirements phase and the acceptance 
phase in the classical sense. But iterate the design, implement and test
phases.

This approach is useful when the only people who believe in agile processes
are the developers. The problem is that many organisations have existing 
processes that codify how requirements are "dumped" into research and 
development. The requirements and acceptance phase are the interfaces to the 
larger organisation, everything in between could be fairies and unicorns.
