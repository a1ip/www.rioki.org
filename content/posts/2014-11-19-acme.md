... is the best thing since <del>sliced bread</del> the invention of SSL/TLS. 

The [Electronic Frontier Foundation][1] (EFF), [Mozilla][2], [Akamai][3], 
[Cisco][4] and [IdenTrus][5] have partnered to create a free Certificate 
Authority (CA), [Let's Encrypt][6]. But the real twist is that they have 
removed humans form the certificate signing and revocation process. Finally the 
cherry on the cake is that Bruce Schneier thinks it's an 
"[absolutely fantastic idea][7]".

Enough of appeal to authority, first let us look at what is broken with existing
certificate signing process. The way to get a valid SSL certificate is to create
a signing request and have that signing request turned into a certificate
by the CA. This certificate is then signed against the CA's certificate. 

The SSL signing process is quite solid from a technical and cryptographic 
standpoint, but commonly fails on the human front. The problem is how does the 
CA know you are who you claim to be and that you that you actually own the 
domains the certificate is for?

<!--more-->

Commonly there are different "trust levels" the CA provides. That is depending
on how many hoops you are willing to jump though (and pay), you get signed 
against a different root certificate. But since most browsers accept all 
"trust levels" and most users are oblivious of this, few people bother with 
high "trust levels". 

The lows "trust levels" prone to abuse, since the amount of checks done to 
validate the signing request is relatively low. It has already happened that 
people where able to social engineer themselves some certificates for domains 
they did not own, like these ["hackers" that got themselves a bunch of certificates][8], 
such as for mail.google.com.

The really novel thing that the Let's Encrypt CA has to bring to the table is 
the [Automated Certificate Management Environment][9] (ACME) protocol. The 
protocol removes any human interaction in the signing process. The first step
the of the process is that you need to prove that you own the domain you are
requesting the certificate for. One option to do that is by serving a specific
file from the domain via HTTP. This means you can only request a certificate 
if you are in control of the HTTP server(s) servicing for this domain. 

Once the domain is proven, the certificate signing process works following the
standard SSL model. The difference that it works via a web service and is 
secured by public key cryptography.

The genius about the ACME protocol is, that asks the right questions. It does 
not care who you are, just that you are in control of the domain the certificate
is for. This makes the Let's Encrypt CA strongly reliable, since it is not 
prone to social engineering attacks.

Like any good security application the specification is [publicly available][9] 
and there is even a [working prototype implementation][10]. So until the service 
goes live in summer 2015 a plethora of security researchers will pour over the 
specification and implementation. But from my first look at it, it looks quite 
sane. So I expect that no much will be found, except a few minor details.
