I cleaned up the markup of this website and made it all HTML5 compliant. 
Not that it was invalid, it was valid HTML5, but it did not have all the 
semanic shenanigangs. What did I do? [I mostly altered some tags and CSS.][1] 

The first thing I did was remove the page wrapper. That is, [because there 
already is a wrapper, the body][2]. Yes that is right, did you not know that
all you need to do is add the styles for the wrapper on the body. Well 
I must say I did not.

The next big thing where the change to use the header, nav, article, aside and
footer tags. This was relqtivly straight forward, and I hope [I did avoid
the most common mistakes][3].

But apart form that not so much. The page was already using some HTML5 features,
such as the simplified doctype, the meta charset, the @font-face and rounded 
corners.
