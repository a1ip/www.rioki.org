*I was sitting in the train this morning and did not know what to do. I started
to type random ideas into the text buffer and suddenly I had quite some interesting
results. So I thought I just might share them.*  

Hmm... What shall I write about? 

Lately I have so little motivation when I am home. Even though I come up with 
ideas at work, I am almost incompetent to implement them back home. As a 
result sdpr has not changed since the week end.

I stated to play Crisis 2 and was interrupted after the first 5 minutes. I am
not sure if I even want to continue. I thought that a game should grab you in 
the first 5 minutes... Oh well. 

Interestingly the title sequence (cinematic) has nothing to do with the game. 
I don't really get the point. It is mostly a wack job towards the nano 
suit.

I definitely blog too little. Then again I want to write good long blog entries
and they take like forever to write. Between writing software as a hobby and
playing games there is not so much time left. I should sever the ties to my
friends, that would give lots more time to write software... and make me a 
psychopathic killer...

I am thinking about posting this stuff on my blog... should look through it 
for things that could get me sued.

These small bytes of information could be put into titter posts. Too bad I don't 
have a mobile Internet for this netbook. Do the O2 surf sticks work on GNU/Linux?

I still haven't written a blog post praising the great and innovative musli
serialization library. Probably should. It is really nifty, especially since
I have started to used it for spdr. It works like a charm.

I am almost at work... no thoughts left... maybe I can work for once without all
these little ideas distracting me... probably not.
