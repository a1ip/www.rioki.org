[libxmlmm][2] is an effort by me to maintain a C++ wrapper for [libxml2][1] that only
depends on libxml2 and standard C++. It features a full XML DOM with XPath queries
and the whole shebang offered by libxml2 (validation, DTD, etc.) 

I am proud to anounce the release of version 0.5 of libxmlmm. Only minor
fixes where applied to the code and so marks the heigh stability of the code.
