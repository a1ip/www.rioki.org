I will state this publicly here, because things I state publicly, I 
have a tendency to see though to the end. Since I am rather plagued by the
not invented here symptom, I will force, yes force myself to use third party
libraries. And finally, I will document my progress here in my little nifty 
web journal.

Assignment:

**Write a board game simulation, similar to [Desperate Gods][dg], using mostly 
third party libraries.**

I decided to look into the mature collection of open source libraries:

* [OGRE]
* [Bullet]
* [OIS]
* [CEGUI]

(Isn't it odd how they always come up together.)

For starters I will develop for Windows (32bit) with Visual Studio 2010 and
you can see the code over at the [green github repository][r].
