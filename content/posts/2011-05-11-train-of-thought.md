Minecraft sux! Ok, actually the game rocks, the problem is the software. I
mean it crashes regularly often and is darn slow. Look at it, there are max 
a couple of hundred polygons on screen and my atom + ion platform can't play it.
As comparison, that platform scored an average frame rate of 50 on the 
Half-Life 2: The Last Cost benchmark. It definitely does not help that it is 
written in java...

I registered for the Junien this week end.

Tilt.

This is odd, I have no pending thoughts. Meta discussion / thoughts rock. 

... 2 minutes of silence ...

It is interesting, it feels like I designed my website into a corner. I was 
thinking about adding links to things like my github page or rather a blogroll 
if you will. But I can't think of a really good way to do it. The design looks 
really clean and adding any more seems to clutter it. I am thinking of links 
at the bottom of the site. What would also work, since I basically only want to
link to my github site, would be a corner image. Hmmm, how about a peal off, 
that shows links to different things of mine... 

It is interesting how rubber ducking works. You explain your problem to someone, 
for example your rubber duck, and by talking you end up solving your problem. To
bad I don't have a rubber duck. But, I think that most blogs are for that
purpose...

... that or plain propaganda.

I plan to release my first revision of spdr the next week end. It seems feasible,
let's see. 

... 8 hours later...

I thought about changing my version numbers of my free software projects from 
traditional major.minor.patch to revision based. The thing is that 0.3.0 seems 
kind of lame, especially since this version is stable for quite some time. I will
probably use a scheme following revision.patch. So the next release of, say 
libxmlmm will be r4. If any quick bug patches are needed then they the release
will be r4.1. 

The only problem is, how to flag alpha and beta versions. But since I don't do
that so often, this is probably not so much of an issue. 

The big story is "Microsoft bought Skype"... and I could not care less. Slashdot
is up in arms about it, but I don't really get it. Microsoft probably will not
change the current situation, that would be suicide. In my opinion Microsoft 
does not need the technology, since they could build their own. The move is
more along the lines of removing the only viable opposition. The problem for
Microsoft is, that if they discontinue supporting GNU/Linux and MacOS they will
just herd the people to Google and friends. And that can definitely not be in 
their best interest. But then again it's Microsoft, they don't tend to make the 
rational decisions.
