I have tried noumerous hosting solutions over the years. Up until recently, 
when I switched to [jekyll][1], my requirement was a [LAMP stack][2]. I ran
a number of CMS software, such as [Mambo][3] (now [Joomla][4]), [Typo3][5],
[Dokuwiki][6] or [Drupal][7]. I tried different solutions, form dedicated hosting
over root servers to virtual private servers. Each solution depended on my needs,
at some point I ran 5 website and a dedicated mail service. But my needs have 
shrunk, espceially since I dicovered jekyll.

Currently I have one website (this one) and it is fully static. This requirement
especially does not warant a fully fledged VPS. For some time I ran my site off
[github pages][8]. But since github does not allow jekyll plugins, the entiere 
thing was a big hack. So I looked for static hosting solutions. I looked into
a number of "[cloud][9] storage" solutions, but none really worked for websites,
save [Amazon S3][10]. So now [rioki.org][11] runs off Amazon S3; and it is blazing 
fast!
