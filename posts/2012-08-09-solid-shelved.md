These last two weeks had it's ups and downs. I learned allot about my engine
design, what I was doing wrong and what I was doing right. But I also learned 
that I am somewhat in an impasse. My current design hit a snag when I tried to
integrate a console and scripting. Engine wise these two weeks where a loss, but
that is not the biggest issue.

The elephant in the room is currently the total lack of artistic and narrative 
cohesion. Although this is not so clear from the development snapshots, I am 
meandering around concepts and styles from Tron Legacy over Portal to 
Myst IV's Spire.

The problem is not that I have good ideas, it is how do I implement them with 
the minimal alloted time budget?

**As a result I decided to stop actively developing solid for now.**

It is not fully over though. I will certainly let the ideas breed some more in 
my mind, with all the 25 other ideas I have. I will continue to work on engine 
technology, maybe with a wider focus to integrate more proven frameworks. I 
might even find an engine, that I think is worthwhile. The landscape has changed
since last I looked properly...
