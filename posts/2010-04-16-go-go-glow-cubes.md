I planed to build a game called GlowCubes about a year ago. It basically 
spun of while reading this article about 
<a href="http://www.gamedev.net/reference/programming/features/imgSpaceLigh t/">Image Space Lighting</a> 
(deferred shading). The idea is to solve 
physics based puzzles in a psychedelic environment build from a bunch of 
glowing shapes. 

I basically gave up on most of my projects as I wrote the 
<a href="/2010/04/06/hobby-or-pro.html">Hobby or Pro</a> journal entry. 
It was a big mess (in a very elegant way), since I tried to develop the 
Quick Game Library at the same time and build in on top of that. I went 
though different complete redesigns, since the requirements seemed to 
change and the scope changed.

After seeing the incredible <a href="http://vimeo.com/10670506" >Imagine</a> 
48k demo by <a href="http://games-net.de/hosted/tggc/">TGGC</a>, 
<a href="http://alphanew.net/">CodingCat</a> and 
<a href="http://blu-flame.org/">Hel</a>. (Music by Turri), I kind of 
decided that I like coding interesting graphic stuff and maybe demo 
projects might be a good outlet.

So here is the challenge: 

<strong>Build a demo (not 48k) based on the idea of GlowCubes from 
scratch. The deadline for a complete demo is 1st of May.</strong> 

I will document the project on a daily basis (on days where there is 
progress) and you can see the code at http://github.com/rioki/GlowCubes
