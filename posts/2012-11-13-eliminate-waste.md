At [Siemens], specifically in the research and development of the [Automation 
Systems] \(AS\) division, we are working on implementing a [lean] approach to development;
actually to the entire product life cycle. What that means in practice here, 
is going from an extremely document heavy process to a moderately document 
heavy process with iterations. The real gain is that each project has 
authorship of their process, what used to be strict guidelines now become advice.

The interesting thing about lean, in contrast to other methodologies, is that
it is not a process, but loose principles or rather a state of mind. The AS
formulated 8 lean principles: 

1. Focus on value
2. Create knowledge
3. Decide at right time 
4. Deliver fast
5. Respect people
6. Build quality in
7. Optimize the whole
8. Keep on improving

If you contrast that with the [7 original principles by Mary Poppendieck and 
Tom Poppendieck][1] you will see that most are just a different working of
the principle. The only two that stick out are "focus on value" and 
"keep on improving". "Keep on improving" is actually implied and was only added 
to remind everyone that lean optimization is never done. "Focus on value" is the
opposite wording of "Eliminate Waste" and I think that this wording is counter
to the original idea and may even make things worse.

Interestingly we are not the only ones who diverge from the original wording. 
The Cardiff University calls it ["Create Flow by Eliminating Waste"][2] and
thus puts it into contrast,the Lean Enterprise Institute reduces it
to ["Create Flow"][3] and Leaning Forward elaborates on that idea as
["Make those processes flow"][4]. Apparently flowing is an important concept.
(All three organisations removed people from the equation, by dropping 
"amplify learning" and "empower the team", [people apparently are not important][5].)

I understand where the unease comes from when talking about eliminating waste. 
Waste is an ugly thing and you do not want it in your organisation, you 
want to improve your production and optimize your value chain. By changing 
the focus you ignore the underlying issue. You must acknowledge that once you
removed all waste from your production line you are operating at optimum. 

The problem with software development and many service oriented fields, is that
you do not see the waste. Such as bugs that should have been avoidable, 
documentation that nobody reads or unbalanced work allocation, leading to 
overtime for some while others wasting time. 

I think the issue can be better illustrated with an example from a totally
different field: cooking. Let us assume that you need to prepare a feast with
multiple courses for your entire family, uncles, aunts and cousins included.

The focus on value approach as the name says focuses on value and the value
in cooking is the resulting food. So when you focus on value you focus
on putting the greatest care into each step, properly cutting the vegetables,
timing the cooking correctly and elegantly presenting the food. What you do
not do is clean up after each step, your cutting board is dirty, you have 
the discarded cutoff pieces of vegetables and mean or spilt liquids on your work
area. Each step further you must take more care of not getting the bits of 
refuse on your current item you are preparing; you do not want gravy in your 
mouse aux chocolat. To actually get this done you need to either use more 
tools (spoons, cutting boards or pots) or do some ad hock clean up of the
necessary tools.

If you take the eliminate waste approach you do the same basic steps, except
you clean up after each major step. This has the advantage that each step can
be done efficiently without any impediments, since all tools are clean and
everything is ready to be used. You also need less inventory since you can 
reuse tools from one step to the next. 

The important message to take away from the example is that "focus on value" is
not the inversed form of "eliminate waste", it is something significantly 
different.

Eliminate waste is a fundamental idea and I think it is the most important of 
the seven lean principles. The basic idea is that you constantly look out for
places where effort is wasted and friction happens and try to reduce that. In a 
development environment it is not that hard, you listen to your developers, 
they will moan that this or that is terrible. You may not able to change 
everything, but that is a starting point.
