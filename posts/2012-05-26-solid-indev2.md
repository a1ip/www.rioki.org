Wow, I made it! The next development snapshot of Solid is here! I can't believe
that the [last snapshot] was over two months ago. I will try to release snapshots 
more often.

This release focused primarily on developing a scene editor, but also saw a 
significant overhaul of the engine architecture. And a few things did not make 
it into the release that where in InDev1; especially the actual game play.

You can [download and try out the InDev2 version of Solid][id2].
