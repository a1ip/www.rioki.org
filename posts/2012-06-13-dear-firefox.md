it has been a very long time that we where together. I remember the 2.0 times
where we tried to show the world the evils of Internet Explorer. Those where 
great times. Times of innovation, times times of pleasure and times of freedom.

But recently you started to get on my nerves. First you started to focus on
superficialities, like the themes instead, of inovating the experiance. You
started to get slower and slower. I know that measuments told you where getting
faster, but it did not feel that way. You can't blame me, I has only 3 plugins 
installed, Ad-Block Plus, Better Privacy and HTTPS-Everywhere. But even without 
these you did not perform well and even starting with a fresh profile did not 
help. Especially latly in the last two or three versions you kept freezing up. 
You would start to load a page and suddenlty the entiere application froze for 
a second or two. I know that it takes a while to load a page, but you should 
not prevent me to use other tabs.

This is un acceptable, I can't go on like this. I still belive in free software 
and I still belive in a browser by the people for the people. But until you
get your act together, we can't be together anymore. 

Sincerly,

Rioki
