If you ever think "I should sit down and make a plan", you need to use [Pivotal 
Tracker][1]. It is not an agile management and planing tool, it is common 
project management sense distilled.

Enough of the big praising words, I really think that Pivotal Tracker is the 
most sensible tool you can use to plan and track your project's progress. It 
praises itself with being agile and you will find terms such as "stories", 
"velocity", "backlog" and "iteration", but in it's essence it just works, no
matter what you think about agile.

The interface is structured loosely on the kanban board concept. Although you 
can arrange the columns as you like, it comes with the above view. The stories 
"flow" right to left and rise to the top. This means that the most pressing 
item is on the top left, below the completed items.

In the "Current" column you see all this iteration's tasks, the "Backlog" are the 
scheduled tasks split into their iterations. The "Icebox" contains all non 
scheduled tasks, this is where you will commonly find the "maybe" features. 

Tasks can be a "Story", "Bug", "Chore" or "Release". 

The primary element you will use is the "Story" type. I like to think of this 
as either an actual feature or a work package. I also refrain from the 
"As <role> I need <feature> as to <goal>.", because I almost always can not wrap 
my head around these broad categories. I have "Stories", such as "Normal Mapping", 
"Screen Serialisation" and such.

Adding "Stories" is really easy, so easy you need to be mindful not to get to 
carried away. Now that you have collected all your features you need to get into
planing. This is done with two means, first you order the tasks by their priority. 
This provides a strict ordering of all your tasks, no "low", "medium", "hight"
and "must", where 90% of the features end up in "must". Hard choices must be 
made, which feature above with other.

Here "Releases" can be created and inserted into the order of the tasks. 

<img class="img-responsive" src="/images/pivotal/Estimate.png" alt="Estimate by clicking on small bars." />

The next step is to estimate the "Stories". There are currently three schemes 
of doing it, Linear (0, 1, 2, 3), Powers of Two (0, 1, 2, 4, 8) and 
Fibonacci (0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8). You estimate the "Stories" with some form of 
idealized time, use hours, days or just arbitrary weights. It actually does 
not matter, as long as you are consistent throughout the project. I personally
prefer Powers of Two, because it is easy to say, this task is roughly double 
that task. If forces you to make a thought choice, is this task 8 or 4?
But Fibonacci may fancy those that like to play a game [Planing Poker].

The prioritized and estimated tasks are placed into the backlog. They 
automatically fill up into the current iteration. This will start to give you a 
feeling of how long the project will take. But currently the velocity is totally 
wrong, since it is at a currently configured default value.

Now the work flow is simple, a developer starts to work on a "Story". He tells
the team this by hitting the "Start" button. This marks the task as in progress,
that is it goes from white to yellow. If the work is done, the "Story" is
marked done, with "Finish" button. But since almost everybody uses something
like a nightly build, the story can be marked as delivered/built by hitting 
the "Deliver" button. This is useful, since there is no point in testing a 
feature that is not yet in the hands of the tester.

Now the tester or stakeholder can mark the features as accepted or rejected. If
the feature is accepted, it is marked as accepted by being green. If the story
is rejected, with a reason, work can be restarted on the "Story".

"Bugs" are like "Stories", except they are not estimated. It is assumed that 
they are a constant drag on the project. Similarly "Chores" are not estimated,
but additionally they are not accepted by the tester/stakeholder, they are only 
marked as done. The idea is that "Chores" are tasks such as "setup nightly build".

"Releases" are special and only loosely fit into the task concept. The unique 
feature is that they can be assigned a due date. The interesting bit is that
if the release happens to be scheduled behind the due date, it automatically
becomes red.

The real beauty of the "Pivotal Tracker" comes after a your first iteration is
over. (If don't like to think about iterations, think about weeks.) Now you know
how many story points you where able to work on. The updated velocity will 
automatically reschedule all tasks. As time goes on your running 
average more accurately reflects what you and your team can do. This very 
accurately predicts when a feature will be done. With the releases 
armed with due dates, you will know how likely you will make it.

This is driven home with the charts. Especially the "Release Burn Down" shows
you how you are on track to the release. (Oh wonder, the team working on the "My
Sample Project" will just barely make the beta release.)

I have used Pivotal Tracker extensively for my hobby projects and it is uncannily
accurate, unfortunately in many cases it also told me very accurately that I am 
totally in over my head.

If you happen, like me, to work in an organisation that thinks all hosted services
are evil, you can use the free software [fulcrum][3]. It is basically a clone of
pivotal tracker, just not as refined. The primary advantage is, you can install 
it on a server in your LAN. 

*Disclaimer: I just like Pivotal Tracker, I have nothing to do with them, except
that I am a satisfied user.*
