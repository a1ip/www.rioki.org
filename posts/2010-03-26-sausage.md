[Gamasutra][1] has yet a interesting feature article: [Inside the Sausage 
Factory: The Art of IP Development][2]. 

It is a rundown of how to develop IP based on common trends. Basically 
the article describes how publishers of media create more of the 
mediocre stuff to service to a fad. From a business standpoint this make 
sense, but artistically it is nonsense. It will not create a new trend 
or rich media. 

The author seems to take himself a bit ironically: Inside the Sausage 
Factory. Sausages are yummy, but not the height of culinary delight.
