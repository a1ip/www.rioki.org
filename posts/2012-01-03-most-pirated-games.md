The Escapist recently [reported][1] on the Torrent Freak's [latest numbers on piracy][2]. 
I hate when things get reported in this form. They are not wrong, but things
like that are taken with a very strong bias.

I will just take the PC number stated in the report, since they are by
far the biggest:

<table width="100%">
  <tr>
    <th>Game</th><th>Downloads</th><th>Release</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Crysis 2</td><td>3,920,000</td><td>Mar. 2011</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</td><td>3,650,000</td><td>Nov. 2011</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Battlefield 3</td><td>3,510,000</td><td>Oct. 2011</td>
  </tr>  
  <tr>
    <td>FIFA 12</td><td>3,390,000</td><td>Sept. 2011</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Portal 2</td><td>3,240,000</td><td>Apr. 2011</td>
  </tr>
</table>

For starters I doubt on the correctness of the numbers. How did they collect the 
data? I will assume they mean downloads via torrent, the numbers come from 
Torrent Freak anyway. To get accurate data they need to track the users of all 
torrent trackers, that is including all private trackers. It is impossible that 
they have access to every private tracker, especially since many are invite only.
Also many users follow multiple trackers, so there is a source of 
duplicate entries. Finally some versions are incomplete, broken or malware 
infected, so people tend to download multiple versions of one game to get 
a running install. At very best they give a roughs estimate of actual pirated copies.

But the numbers must also be put into context. I foraged the Internet for sales
figures, not the easiest task. (Thanks to Wikipedia, where I found most of the 
sources.) The sales numbers I was able to find:

<table width="100%">
  <tr>
    <th>Game</th><th>Sales</th><th>Release</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Crysis 2</td><td><a href="http://investor.ea.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=594196">"over 3 million"</a></td><td>Mar. 2011</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</td><td><a href="http://www.nintendogal.com/2011/12/09/november-2011-npd-group-us-sales-charts/9933">"approximately 9,000,000"</a></td><td>Nov. 2011</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Battlefield 3</td><td><a href="http://www.computerandvideogames.com/327893/battlefield-3-ships-12-million-copies/">"12 million copies after one month"</a></td><td>Oct. 2011</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Portal 2</td><td><a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/35402/Newell_Portal_2_Has_Sold_3_Million_Copies.php">"3 million copies"</a></td><td>Apr. 2011</td>
  </tr>
</table>

I found it almost impossible to find sales numbers for PC only. Apparently 
MW3 and BF3 sold significantly stronger on consoles, so the PC numbers may be 
less. 

If you compare the downloads to the sales you come to the following "conversion
rate".

<table width="100%">
  <tr>
    <th>Game</th><th>Sales</th><th>Downloads</th><th>Ratio</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Crysis 2</td><td>3,000,000</td><td>3,920,000</td><td>0.76</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</td><td>9,000,000</td><td>3,650,000</td><td>2.46</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Battlefield 3</td><td>12,000,000</td><td>3,510,000</td><td>3.41</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Portal 2</td><td>3,000,000</td><td>3,240,000</td><td>0.92</td>
  </tr>
</table>

The ratio is the sales numbers divided by the downloads; that is a better number
means the game fared better and a number below 1 means more downloads than sales.

Putting that into context Modern Warfare and Battle Field definitely had it going
for them. In contrast Crysis 2 and Portal 2 are in a more dire situation with 
more copies downloaded than sold.

How much was lost? This I honestly can't say. 

Modern Warfare and Battlefield fared significantly better for a number of obvious
reasons. First they are basically multiplayer only; any person that got the game
for the single player only, basically got ripped off. Multiplayer games have the 
advantage with server key authentication that you need a legitimate key to play
on a legitimate server. That is one of the reasons why the server software was 
never publicly released for Modern Warfare. But even with pirated servers, 
peer pressure will basically ensure that most people get a legitimate version, 
so they can play with their peers that got the legit version.

Many pirates are potential customers, I know a few that try before they buy. 
But trust in a franchise will buy you allot of people. That is one of the reasons
why Left 4 Dead saw way worse sales/download ratio than Left 4 Dead 2; people
trusted in the franchise. With both MW3 and BF3 there where both record breaking
pre-orders, which indicates the huge trust people put into franchises.

On the other hand Crysis 2 and Portal 2 are single player games. I don't know
if the Crysis 2 Multiplayer has any impact on the FPS community, I for one do
not hear much about it. As a result the "need" to have a legitimate copy is 
significantly less. The games must sell on the merit of the game it's self. 

Crysis 2 is an exceptionally difficult candidate. If you look at Crysis 2's 
[Metacritic score][7] you will see a mostly positive press and quite some
negative user reviews. I think the reason why Crysis 2 was pirated so much was
that many PC games wanted to try the beast before they bought it. It was mixed
feelings with Crysis 2, on the one hand Crysis was one of the icons of PC gaming
and on the other hand if was perceived as a console port. The deception of many 
PC gamers is well seen in the mediocre sales numbers.

Portal 2 something I can't really explain. But being a single player game and
relatively short, it appears difficult to favor pirate conversions. This is because
exposure time is a factor; if you are constantly reminded that you like this games
and should buy it every time you launch the game chances are you will actually buy
it. If you play though the game in something around 2 play sessions, there is
not so much mental reminders and I don't know if the co-op play makes much 
of a difference here. (I had trouble to find friends to play with.)

But at this point no one has mentioned the elephant in the room. If you look at 
the numbers, they all lie in the same magnitude. All PC numbers are in the 3 - 4
Mio. bracket. If you look at the average pirate behavior, most of them will download
almost anything out there, what do you think the tera byte hard drives arrays are 
good for? There is a significant chance that most people that downloaded one 
of the mentioned titles also downloaded all of the other. The question is, does 
it make a difference in sales?
