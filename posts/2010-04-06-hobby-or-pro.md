Over the last 3 years I tried to develop a number of game projects with 
the aim to sell them. Each project ran out of steam, mostly because of 
scale and lack of time. Each project was smaller in scale then the 
previous and still failed. Every time I said oh it is just a hobby, but 
a certain disappointment still remains. 

One of the biggest problems I have is the fact that I have not found one 
game engine that was worthwhile. As a result a large amount of effort 
was invested into developing technology. Now I have partially finished 
technology, but still no games. 

I have never seriously considered to work professionally in game 
development. For the first fact, my current job just pays to darn well 
and is extremely safe. Being a father and husband, this is the sensible 
thing to do. If I develop games, then with that safety net in place. 

What drives me is the fun of developing and figuring out new things. I 
need to acknowledge this fact and that until I do have a publishing 
contract or you can download my game from steam, it remains a hobby. 
Maybe I can live better with this mindset and stop trying to force me to 
create a feasible game idea and design. I just do it because it's fun.
