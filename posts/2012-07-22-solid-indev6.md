This development has a rather tragic story. To illustrate that tragedy, coming
close to a classic Greek tragedy, I wrote a short screen play for you.

Somewhere in my dark schizophrenic mind, my different personae meet. Think of
a [boring meeting room][bmr].

    Monday, 9th of July: Iteration Kickoff Meeting

    rioki(Manager):     OK team, this iteration we will focus on the 
                        editor. Let's make the editor ready for prime 
                        time.

    rioki(Artist):      Nice. The current state of affairs is just 
                        frustrating, my pristine art will not touch 
                        abomination.

    rioki(Programmer):  Whatever! 
    
                        There are some minor issues I want to have 
                        resolved. 

    rioki(Designer);    I have been thinking, how about we make the 
                        primary level geometry voxels. Just like 
                        Minecraft. It will be really easy to edit 
                        and all.
                       
    rioki(Programmer):  We have been over this! The current 
                        implementation is good enough. We want to
                        take the same approach like Overgrowth.
                        You know, use modular set pieces and arrange 
                        and combine them.

    rioki(Artist):      Thanks for the extra work.

    rioki(SoundArtist): Until you guys haven't implemented sound I 
                        will not even start.

    rioki(Manager):     We know that.
    
                        OK team let's get this show on the road.

                        
    Wednesday, 18th of July: At the coffee machine.

    rioki(Manager):     So guys, how are we doing?

    Artist, Designer and Programmer look away.

    rioki(Manager):     Guys, so how are we doing?

    rioki(Programmer):  I was trying things out, like on my hobby 
                        project. Did you know that it is really easy 
                        to build web applications with flask?

    rioki(Artist):      I did, ... um ... research ... um ... I did 
                        research into ... um ... Shogun 2, you know 
                        Steam Summer Sale and all.
                        
    rioki(Designer):    I still think we need voxels. I have been 
                        thinking about how the editor can integrate 
                        voxels.
                        
    rioki(SoundArtist): No sound system, nuf said.
                        
    rioki(Manager):     Gyaaa!!! What you did no progress at all?! 
                        OK what was the problem?!

    rioki(Designer):    The game is not fun! It is totally not 
                        playable!

    rioki(Programmer):  Yea the movement system it still buggy and 
                        the "gravity gun" is still not implemented.
                        
    rioki(Manager):     OK. Focus on making the game playable. So 
                        that we have some progress.
