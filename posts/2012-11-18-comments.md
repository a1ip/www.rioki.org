I am torn on the subject of comments. At first I had comments on posts,
simply because that is what everybody did. But in the early days of my journal
I did not see the point, since all comments I got where spam. When I switched to
[Jekyll] and used [Disqus] for comments, the spam went away; the volume of ham 
(good comments) kept the same, almost none. At which point I removed the 
comments completely.

After reading Jeff Atwood's [Blogging about Blogging][2] post, I 
re-enabled the comments. The point he reiterates Rory's guideline on comments:

    A blog without comments is not a blog. Period. If there's no two-way 
    communication-- if readers of your blog can't politely point out that 
    you're full of crap-- then whatever you're writing may be great, but it
    isn't a blog. Without the social dialog of feedback, you're merely 
    publishing-- and publishing is something newspapers have been doing for 
    hundreds of years.

To a certain degree this makes sense and on some blogs, especially Jeff's,
the comments really do add something to the mix. But I don't have the critical 
mass of reader for many comments; [if I ever get any I am taken by surprise][3].

But then again this is not a blog, it is my public journal. We all know that
a blog is a hideous creature that lives at the bottom of a lake and reiterates
on the latest press release from Microsoft, Google or Apple.

The Oatmeal ran a comic about [Some thoughts and musings about making things 
for the web][1], he comments on comments. 

    Art is not born in a vacuum,
    but it's not born inside a tornado full of shrieking trolls, either.

This makes total seance and this if the reason why I disabled the comments
in the first place. (replace trolls with spammers) 

But then again this is not art either, it is my public journal. I have comments
enables only on journal posts and to a certain degree this makes seance. It is 
not like I think I need comments on every page, like comments on the login
and contact page. (I did not find an example for this and Google failed me, 
but I have seen it.)

I think having comments is good, even if it only for you to ask me about my
[Uncrustify config][3].

P.S. I hope to keep the meta journal writing (**not** meta bloging) to a minimum.
