I must admit that I never was a big fan of lara croft, nevertheless 
this trailer is great in so many ways.

First this trailer is well directed, it is gripping, moving and intriging. 
But this is not so suprising, since the art of reating movie and game trailers
should be well understood by now.

Second the trailer uses large ammounts of gameplay footage, even thoug it is 
rather cinematic in nature. You must give it to them, few cinematic game 
trailers are actual gameplay nowadays. The only gameplay you get to see are 
guided demo sequences, that verge on borderline boring. 

Third the narators of the trailer, that are suposed to be players, are all
adults of varies ages, race and sex. What I really like about it is that whoever
made the trailer gets his target demografic, games are played by a number of adults.
This makes especially sense since if a fan played [Tomb Raider] in 1996, they 
must be into thier 30s by now.
