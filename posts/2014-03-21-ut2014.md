With the public release of the [Unreal 4 Engine][1] and 10 years since
the last good Unreal Tournament, I propose a challenge: 

> Build a classic arena shooter reminiscent of [Unteal Turnament 2004][2]. 
>  
> Implement Death Match game mode with one map, one weapon and one character.
> Bonus points for implementing the exact UT2004 movement.
>  
> Choose your own unique theme and look and as far as possible integrate your
> own assets.
>    
> You should build a complete game, that is a packaged executable with menus 
> and all the expected usability. It should look and feel like a full game, 
> albeit with limited level set and gameplay. Bonus points for building an 
> options screen [Total Biscuit][3] would be proud of. 
>   
> You have time until the end of June.

With the release of the Unreal Engine 4 and their tally awesome licensing terms
there is no reason why not try out this engine. (I am only sad that they did not
bring it out earlier, since I invested much time in building my own.)
