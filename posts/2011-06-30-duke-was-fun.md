Everybody agrees, Duke Nukem Forever got really bad reviews. You can
basically put the reviews into two categories, those that complained
that Duke Nukem Forever was not enough like Call of Duty and those
that complained that Duke Nukem Forever was not enough like the 
original Duke Nukem 3D. But I tend to disagree and I think
they kind of miss the point. Sure the game is not perfect, but the 
game was fun!

I assume that there are very few people that where able to keep 
their hopes high for the duration of all 12 years. For me, I 
basically assumed they kept the thing going as a publicity 
stunt at around 2000. But if you did then, definitely the game
is a disappointment. The important part is that 12 years development
are a management failure on the side of 3D Realms and has
nothing to do with the final game. By the way, for those
that dig deeper in the development history of Duke Nukem Forever,
will learn the game we got today was approximately only 5 years 
in development, the previous attempt was scratched. It is still
a bad score, but no as terrible as everybody said.

So if you take the game as it is, it is not that bad. You
know what? I had a blast playing the game. Yes the graphics
are not up to par, yes the puzzles are easy, yes the story
is ridiculous, but the entire experience hit the right nerve.

This was a game where I really had fun playing. It wasn't 
deep, compelling, interesting or intriguing; it was fun. 
The speed of movement, the almost unlimited availability of 
ammo, the high number of relative simple enemies and the
relative complex timed boss fights really where timed and 
executed in a manner that was just plain fun.

Many have said that games have evolved since the conception
of Duke Nukem Forever and the game was just not up to par. 
But in my opinion those few things that followed the common
"modern" trend rather deterred from the experience than added
to it. 

Seriously, since when where quick time events fun? Tapping
repeatedly on the space bar to open a door or keying in a 
specific sequence to kill a boss where simply just annoying. 

The fact that you can only carry two weapons, because your
average console player is incapable to count to three,
is just utter nonsense. Yes, I know that the official reason
is that they did not find a way to map the weapons to the 
controller; but if I can select a weapon with the mouse wheel 
and specific with mouse button 4 (shock rifle) and 5 
(rocket launcher) in Unreal Tournament; then maybe it is 
possible to map 5 weapons to a controller with 11 keys and 
two analog sticks. You know what, I do not want to make
a guess of what is to come next and chose my weapon, I want
to have the choice in the encounter. This lead to the 
weird situation that the RPG just happens to lie around
when the next boss was up to come.

With health regeneration, I was not sure if that actually
made the game harder or simpler. Sure you could just
hide behind cover, like a school girl and poof your 
ego was fully recharged. But on the other hand, in the 
original Duke Nukem 3D you could take a few rockets to 
the face and still run around. With Duke Nukem Forever
if you pick up a direct rocket hit, you would better get
your pink tutu out and look for handy cover. Interestingly 
on the other hand Duke can absorb tons of repeated 
splash damage as you can very well see in the first
boss fight in the stadium. 

I agree with most reviewers, Duke Nukem Forever was not
a great game; but honestly, it was more fun that almost
anything that came out in the last 5 years.
