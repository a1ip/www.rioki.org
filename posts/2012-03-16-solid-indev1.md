Remember [Glow Cubes][gc], probably not since I don't have that many recuring
visitors. (Maybe we can change that...)

Since around October 2011 I started developing on project "solid". The idea is
to develop a physic based puzzle game within a spaced out environment. With my
relative bad track record, where I wandered into the realm of engine development
and never came back, I set some clear goals:

* develop engine code only within the game project
* develop only what is needed for the next feature
* don't get distracted with nice but usless features
* dedicate a fixed amount of time to the project to guarantee progress

Although I did not stay on the track all the time I can declare that I succeded 
to get the first playable version. It surly lacks a good number of levels 
and features, but it is way more than I ever achived so far.

I may go into the technicall details on an other time, but
